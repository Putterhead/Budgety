# Budgety
Another exercise I did in creating an interface in JS (the CSS and HTML were provided) for a budget app and is based on Jonas Schmedtmanns' Udemy course (https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course/learn/v4/overview).

User Stories:
```

I want to be able to input an expense

As a user
