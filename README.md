# Budgety
Another exercise I did in creating an interface in JS (the CSS and HTML were provided) for a budget app and is based on Jonas Schmedtmanns' Udemy course (https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course/learn/v4/overview).

As with other apps I've been working on recently, I've commented just about every line of code, and I know, it's ugly. But please just try to ignore that - writing the comments, really helps me internalise it.
